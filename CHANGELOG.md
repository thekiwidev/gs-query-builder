## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-20 - Fixed Operator Chaining Validation Logic

### Fixed

- **Critical: Operator Chaining Validation Flaws** - Fixed two major validation issues in `lib/operatorValidator.ts`

  - **Issue 1: First block not validated against next block**

    - Forward-chain validation (checking current block's `next` direction against next block's operator) was incorrectly nested within `blockIndex > 0` condition
    - This skipped validation of the first block (index 0), allowing invalid operator chains starting at position 0
    - Fixed by implementing forward check that runs for all blocks from index 0 to n-2

  - **Issue 2: Overly broad conflict detection**
    - Conflict checks were flagging valid operator sequences as errors (e.g., `AND with next` followed by `OR with next`)
    - This incorrectly rejected cases where one chain ends and another begins (perfectly valid in Boolean logic)
    - Fixed by implementing precise rules: only flag direct conflicts (e.g., `AND with next` followed by `OR with previous`)

- **Implementation Changes:**

  1. **Backward Check (for blocks 1 to n-1):**

     - Validates blocks with `operator="AND/OR"` and `operatorDirection="previous"`
     - Compares against previous block's `operatorDirection="next"` and operator type
     - Only flags error if operators differ (AND paired with OR or vice versa)

  2. **Forward Check (for blocks 0 to n-2):**

     - Validates blocks with `operator="AND/OR"` and `operatorDirection="next"`
     - Compares against next block's operator type and direction
     - Only flags error for direct incompatible pairs:
       - `(operator: AND, direction: next)` followed by `(operator: OR, direction: previous)` → ERROR
       - `(operator: OR, direction: next)` followed by `(operator: AND, direction: previous)` → ERROR
     - Allows chain boundaries (e.g., AND→next followed by OR→next)

  3. **Enhanced error messages:**
     - Messages now explain exactly which block has which operator
     - Suggestions guide users to fix the specific incompatibility
     - Example: "Cannot use OR with previous when the previous block uses AND with next"

### Technical Details

- Rule 4 in `operatorValidator.ts` completely rewritten for correctness (lines 73-108)
- Backward check runs for blocks with `operatorDirection="previous"` (blocks 1 to n-1)
- Forward check runs for blocks with `operatorDirection="next"` (blocks 0 to n-2)
- No block validation is skipped; coverage is complete from index 0 to last block
- Direct conflicts are the only errors flagged; valid chain transitions are allowed
- `ValidationResult` interface updated to include optional `suggestion` property

### Validation Examples

**Valid (before was incorrectly marked as error):**

- Block 0: `(AND, next)` | Block 1: `(OR, next)` | Block 2: ... ✅ (AND chain, then OR chain)
- Block 0: `(OR, next)` | Block 1: `(AND, next)` | Block 2: ... ✅ (OR chain, then AND chain)

**Invalid (now correctly caught at position 0):**

- Block 0: `(AND, next)` | Block 1: `(OR, previous)` ❌ (direct conflict - caught by forward check)

**Invalid (still correctly caught):**

- Block 0: `(AND, next)` | Block 1: `(AND, next)` | Block 2: `(OR, previous)` ❌ (OR mismatch - caught by backward check)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-20 - Advanced Operator Chaining and Parenthetical Grouping

### Added

- **Advanced Operator Chaining Validation** - Sophisticated operator relationship enforcement

  - Directional operator types: AND_NEXT, AND_PREV, OR_NEXT, OR_PREV, EXCLUDE
  - Prevents invalid operator combinations (e.g., AND_NEXT followed by OR_PREV)
  - Context-aware operator filtering in SearchBlockComponent
  - PREV operator must match previous block's NEXT operator to maintain chain integrity
  - Comprehensive validation in operatorValidator.ts Rule 4

- **Intelligent Parenthetical Grouping** - Automatic chain detection and grouping

  - Identifies complete chains by checking forward (NEXT) and backward (PREV) connections
  - All connected blocks stay in same parenthesis group regardless of intermediate blocks
  - Chain breaking: Blocks disconnect only when operators don't connect
  - Example: Block1(AND_NEXT) Block2(OR_NEXT) Block3() Block4(AND_PREV) = (Block1 AND Block2 OR Block3 AND Block4)
  - Rewritten groupBlocksByOperator() function in qtm.ts with full chain detection logic

### Changed

- **SearchBlockComponent Operator Validation** (`components/SearchBlockComponent.tsx`)

  - Added allBlocks prop for context-aware validation
  - Implemented getValidOperators() function filtering operators based on previous block
  - Only shows valid operator options in dropdown that don't conflict with chain
  - PREV operator options disabled when incompatible with previous block's NEXT

- **Search Blocks Container** (`components/search/SearchBlocksContainer.tsx`)

  - Now passes allBlocks prop to SearchBlockComponent
  - Enables context-aware operator validation for entire query

- **Query Translation Module** (`lib/qtm.ts`)

  - Complete rewrite of groupBlocksByOperator() function
  - New chain identification algorithm: backward traversal to find chain start, forward traversal to find chain end
  - Helper function getOperatorType() to extract operator from block (supports new and legacy formats)
  - Proper handling of blocks with no explicit operators that are part of a chain
  - Chains properly wrapped in parentheses for all grouped blocks

- **Operator Validator Enhancement** (`lib/operatorValidator.ts`)

  - Added comprehensive Rule 4 for operator chaining validation
  - Bidirectional checking: validates both previous block's connection and next block's connection
  - Specific error messages for AND_NEXT/OR_PREV conflicts and OR_NEXT/AND_PREV conflicts
  - Suggestions provided for fixing operator conflicts

- **Terminology Updates** (Multiple files)

  - Changed "EXCLUDE" to "Does Not Include" for user clarity
  - Updated in SearchBlockComponent operator descriptions
  - Updated in SmartOperatorValidator.tsx description
  - Updated in booleanOperators.ts (NOT operator description)
  - Updated in HowToUsePage.tsx with better "Does Not Include" examples

- **Help Documentation Enhancement** (`components/help/HowToUsePage.tsx`)

  - Added new section: "Understanding Operator Grouping"
  - Replaced query format examples with English behavior descriptions
  - New examples show concrete use cases instead of configuration steps
  - Better explanation of what AND, OR, and "Does Not Include" actually do
  - Improved Example 1, 2, 3 with outcome-focused descriptions
  - Added visual example of operator chaining with expected results

- **Query Builder** (`components/QueryBuilder.tsx`)

  - Removed "Generated Query Display" section showing query string
  - Focus shifted from query syntax to query behavior and results

### Fixed

- Operator chaining no longer allows invalid AND/OR combinations within a chain
- Parenthetical grouping now correctly handles chains with blocks containing no forward operator
- Operator validation now prevents users from selecting incompatible operators
- Help page no longer shows technical query format syntax that confused users

### Technical Details

- Operator chaining uses directional indicators (NEXT/PREV) to create bidirectional connections
- Chain detection is O(n²) but acceptable for typical query sizes (<10 blocks)
- All blocks in a chain must use compatible operators: AND_NEXT must pair with AND_PREV (or AND_NEXT for forwarding)
- Empty blocks (no search term) don't break chains - they're filtered out during query building

### Validation Rules Summary

1. **PREV must match NEXT:** If Block 1 has AND_NEXT, Block 2 must use AND_PREV (not OR_PREV)
2. **All operators valid forward:** Block can have AND_NEXT OR OR_NEXT for next connection, independent of PREV
3. **First block no operators:** Cannot have AND_PREV or OR_PREV on first block
4. **Last block no forward:** Cannot have AND_NEXT or OR_NEXT on last block
5. **EXCLUDE at end only:** "Does Not Include" blocks typically at end of query
6. **No mixing in chain:** All blocks in same parenthesis group must use same operator type for that group

### User Experience Improvements

- Operator dropdown only shows valid choices eliminating user confusion
- Help page explains what operators do instead of how to format them
- Error messages guide users to valid operator configurations
- Consistent terminology ("Does Not Include" instead of "EXCLUDE")

### Notes

- This release makes the operator system much more sophisticated and user-friendly
- Prevents entire categories of invalid queries that would confuse users
- Help documentation now focuses on outcomes rather than syntax
- All changes are backward compatible - legacy booleanOperator still supported

### Fixed

- Sidebar content appearing too early during expansion animation (now fades in smoothly after sidebar finishes expanding)
- Main content falling behind collapsed sidebar (now properly offset by COLLAPSED_SIDEBAR_WIDTH)
- Sidebar overflow issues preventing display of interactive elements beyond sidebar bounds

### Technical Details

- `COLLAPSED_SIDEBAR_WIDTH` constant set to 50px for spacebar-like appearance
- Mobile detection implemented with `window.innerWidth < 768` check on mount and resize
- Absolute positioning with `translate(50%, -50%)` for proper centering of interactive elements
- `overflow-visible` allows buttons positioned outside sidebar to be clickable
- Z-index layering: sidebar (z-40), close button (z-30), fixed buttons (z-50)

### Notes

- Sidebar remains visible even when collapsed, providing clear affordance for expansion
- Mobile overlay prevents accidental content interaction while sidebar is open
- Smooth animations improve perceived performance and UX fluidity
